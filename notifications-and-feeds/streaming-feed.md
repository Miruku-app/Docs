{% hint style="info" %}
There is currently some issues with the streaming announcement and it may not always give the announcement. It will however, always assign the streamer role.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The streaming role will be **automatically removed** from a member that is not streaming if it is given manually, so be careful! If Miruku is removing member's roles without apparent reason, this may well be the cause.
{% endhint %}

Steaming notification is triggered based on your Discord streaming status (When you go purple, AKA streaming). You can either have announcements, be assigned the streaming role or both.&#x20;

### **Announce Channel**

Choose the Channel that you want to bot to post the announcement in.

### Announcement Message

Write the message that you want to announcement to say. The streaming announcements accept most [templates](../reference/templates/), but have some additional special templates:

* `{{ .URL }}` outputs the URL of the stream.
* `{{ .Game }}` outputs the current game.
* `{{ .StreamTitle }}` outputs the stream title.
* `{{ .User.Username }}` outputs the Discord username of the person who is streaming.

### Game Regex

Use [regex ](../reference/regex.md)to filter out games to post announcements and assign roles for specific games.

### Currently Streaming Role

Assign this role to the people streaming.&#x20;

### Whitelist role

Only assign a role and make announcement for the people with this role.

### Ignore role

Do not assign a role and make an announcement for people with this role.&#x20;

### Stream Title Regex

Use [regex ](../reference/regex.md)to filter out streams based on the title of their stream
