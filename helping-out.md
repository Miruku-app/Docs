## Writing the documentation

Miruku is one of the more complicated bots out there. Therefore, a lot of documentation is needed for people to fully utilize and understand the features the bot provides.

If you're interested in adding things to the documentation, contact us on our [support server](https://discord.gg/nP3Xu77r3b).
