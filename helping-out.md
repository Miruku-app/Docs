# Helping out

There are several ways you can help in making YAGPDB better!

* Supporting us through Patreon
* Writing documentation. The bot needs documentation - More details below
* Help out other people on Discord
* Writing code.

## Writing the documentation

YAGPDB is one of the more complicated bots out there. Therefore, a lot of documentation is needed for people to fully utilize and understand the features the bot provides.

If you're interested in adding things to the documentation, contact us on our [support server](https://discord.gg/GcpyYh3).

## Writing code for the bot

You can also write code for the bot - it's open source. The bot is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and you can view its code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb). Please only add features if you really know how to write code in go. If you don't know how to change files on GitHub, watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ).
